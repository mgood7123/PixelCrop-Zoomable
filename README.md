just zoom in, then tap `Add Layer`

where you can review your zoom history and make changes

changes made to one layer affect all following layers

tap `Remove Layer` to remove the last added layer

### Zoom Previews

each `Zoom Layer` consists of its own `Main Image`, and `Zoomed Image`

the `Main Image` is where you can zoom in on your picture
